Instructions  
1. Run the program and see the output.
2. Modify the program so that it prints your name after John Cleese. For example, Mr. Pawelski's program produced the following output...

Monty Python's
Flying Circus

Staring John Cleese and Nolan Pawelski


3. Lastly, be prepared to answer the questions below...
    a. What happens when you donâ€™t put anything inside the parentheses of the print() function?
    b. In SimplePrint program, we used single quotes around the text to be displayed, but in this program, we used double quotes.
       Is there any difference between using single quotes (') and double quotes (")?
